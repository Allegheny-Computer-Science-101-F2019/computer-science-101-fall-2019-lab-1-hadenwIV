## For each Gradle command, add an explanation to the following list

- `gradle build`: Allows you to 'build' the program or software.
- `gradle run`: Allows you to 'run' the program or software.
- `gradle grade`: Checks to see if program has any errors and runs correctly.
- `gradle test`: Tests the program for any bugs or malfunctions.

## The `CreditCard` constructor uses the `this` keyword. What does it mean?

The keyword 'this' is used to refer an object or to reference an instance variable
of the class that you are in.

## The `CreditCard` class contains a `static` method. How does it work?

The class 'static' is accessed befCreditCard uses wallet to call each and every bank account with its information
ore any other objects in the class and can
access a static member without creating a another class.

## The `CreditCard` class has a `main` method. What is the purpose of this method?

The 'main' class is used to indicate to the computer that the class with 'main'
is the program that runs first.

## How does the `CreditCard` class use a `while` and `for` loop?

**/ Please provide a response to this question. /**

The 'CreditCard' class uses a while loop to implement the total balance of the
customer's account and is used to calculate the new balance.

'CreditCard' class also uses the for loop to call the card and account information
such as the account numbers and bank.

## The `CreditCard` creates variable called `wallet`. What is it? How does it work?

**/ Please provide a response to this question. /**
'CreditCard' uses wallet to call each and every bank account with its information
such as the name of the bank, the account numbers, the amounts, and the limit
to which the customer can deposit and withdraw from the account.


## What challenges did you face during this assignment? How did you solve them?

Some challenges I faced were trying to remember how to do certain things
that I have either never done, or that I haven't used since my first semester
at Allegheny; which most of it is a blur to me at the moment. On the other hand,
the more I work with my colleagues the more my first Computer Science class at
Allegheny comes back to mind. It was extremely difficult for me to know what
exactly to do because I did not recall what methods to use and how to implement
methods; that being the case, I was stuck on this laboratory project until I was
forced to face it when I was running out of time to actually finish the project.

## After completing this assignment, what is one experience for which you are grateful?

I am grateful to get this lab completed, because I was confused the whole
time working on the assignment since I knew how to do variance and that was
needed to find standard deviation through code . I  procrastinated throughout the
week since it was declaring the sum of all variables in the array then squaring
them that became a real problem since I didn't how to square factors within java. 
That being said, I am also grateful for my colleagues (Chaz Montgomery and Andrew
Rankins-Bell) helping me through the process and for the another fellow classmate
who briefly explained to me what a fenced code block was and how to implement it
into my reflection and who also broke down and explained to me how to calculate
the Variance and taught me in a way in which I would understand. I would also like to
say that I am also grateful that you gave me this assignment because it really tested
my patience. I was getting overwhelmed when I kept check style errors and trying to
rectify them was trial and error and was getting increasingly frustrated fixing them.
In the end, I still did not fix all of my check style errors, but I would
